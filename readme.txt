Creates an interface you can use to scan your website for external links. Also optionally can add an alert and icon to all external links (meaning those with target="_blank").

AccessibilityPress is focused on building products that help websites achieve high accessibility standards including:

    -508 compliance
    -WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0 A, AA or AAA level of conformance

== Description ==

It is highly recommended that if a link is external (leaving your website) you warn users a new window will be opened. 

The best way to do this is to add text to the link such as "Opens in a new window". 

You can also optionally add an icon to indicate it is an external link. 

This WordPress plugin will evaluate each page of your website and produce a page-by-page report of where you have external links. 

Additionally, it has an option to activate an external link alert on each of the found links in the form of an icon and the hidden text "Opens in a new window" - which will be read by a screen reader.



= How it Works: =

The plugin uses a combination of PHP and javascript to scan each page of your site for external links with the attribute target="_blank".

An example is <a target="_blank" href="http://google.com">Descriptive link text</a>
